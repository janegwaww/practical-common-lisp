** Translate the following expressions...

1.Translate the following expressions into equivalent expressions that don't use let or let*, and don't cause the same expression to be evaluated twice.

#+begin_src lisp
  ;; a)
  (let ((x (car y)))
    (cons x x))
  ;; equivalent with a)
  ((lambda (x)
     (cons x x))
   (car y))

  ;; b)
  (let* ((w (car x))
         (y (+ w z)))
    (cons w y))
  ;; equilvalent with b)
  ((lambda (w)
     ((lambda (y)
       (cons w y))
      (+ w z)))
   (car x))
#+end_src

** Rewrite mystery (page 29) to use ~cond~.

** Define a function that returns the...

3.Define a function that returns the square of its argument, and which does not compute the square if the argument is a positive integer less than or equal to 5.

** Rewrite ~num-month~ (Figure 5.1) to use ~case~ instead of ~svref~.

** Define iterative and recursive versions...

5.Define iterative and recursive versions of a function that takes an object ~x~ and vector ~v~, and returns a list of all the objects that immediately precede ~x~ in ~v~:

#+begin_src lisp
  ;;> (precedes #\a "abracadabra")
  ;;(#\c #\d # \ r)
#+end_src

** Define iterative and recursive versions...

6.Define iterative and recursive versions of a function that takes an object and a list, and returns a new list in which the object appears between each pair of elements in the original list:

#+begin_src lisp
  ;; > (intersperse '- '(a b e d))
  ;; (A - B - C - D)
#+end_src

** Define a function that takes...

7.Define a function that takes a list of numbers and returns true if the
difference between each successive pair of them is 1, using

(a) recursion
(b) ~do~
(c) ~mapc~ and ~return~

** Define a single recursive function...

8.Define a single recursive function that returns, as two values, the maximum and minimum elements of a vector.

** The program in Figure 3.12 continues...

9.The program in Figure 3.12 continues to search as the first complete
path works its way through the queue. In broad searches this would be
a problem.

(a) Using ~catch~ and ~throw~, modify the program to return the first complete path as soon as it is discovered.
(b) Rewrite the program to do the same thing without using ~catch~ and ~throw~.
