4.Define a function that takes a two-dimensional array of floats and displays it in neat columns. Each element should be printed with two digits after the decimal point, in a field 10 characters wide. (Assume all will fit.) You will need ~array-dimensions~ (page 361).

** Modify ~stream-subst~ so that...

6.Modify ~stream-subst~ so that the pattern can include an element that matches any digit character, an element that matches any alphanumeric character, or an element that matches any character. The pattern must also be able to match any specific input character. (Hint: ~old~ can no longer be a string.)
